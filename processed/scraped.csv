To access Data Catalog, you need a global role with the Catalog global permission, for example Catalog Author. To assemble data sets, Collibra Data Intelligence Cloud must register metadata from data sources. This means that metadata is read from sources that are not yet governed in Collibra itself, so registering a data source is not the same as importing data. These data sources can be databases as well as files.   "
